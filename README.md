<h2>Project Thoughts:</h2>
<p> Overall, I really enjoyed the opportunity to work on this project. I particularly liked getting to work with the zendesk api and got a lot of satisfaction out of seeing the data connect to my client and bring the project to life. If I had more time, I would've like to worked more on polishing the app and improving the error handling. </p>
